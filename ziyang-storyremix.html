      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>My roommate Oliver is from Chengdu, China. Chengdu is a city where almost everybody likes spicy food such as hotpot.
        Since it's pretty hard to find similar spicy food in Davis, Oliver tried to bring as many food as possible back to America.
        However, the custom of the United States does not allow people to carry any food into the country, but Oliver did not know this regulation.
        He filled both of his luggages with all kinds of local snack, seasoning, and so on. Unfortunately, when Oliver was going through the custom, the dog at the U.S. custom barked at him pretty crazily.
        Thus, the security people at the custom checked his luggages and found all his food and confiscate all of them.
        What's more, Oliver was sent to the office and was investigated for six hours, so he missed his registered driver and came home at 3am in the morning.

        He filled both of his luggages with all kinds of local snack, seasoning, and so on. Fortunately, when Oliver was going through the custom, the security people did not check his luggages, so Oliver passed the custom pretty quickly.
        Therefore, Oliver made it to his registered car on time and came home pretty early.
