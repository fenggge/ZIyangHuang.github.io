      <p>Machine Learning and Web is basically seen as a kind of algorithm that could analyze the data in the computer system and then come up with a law which would be able to predict the unknown data by using the law. Thus, Machine Learning is like a branch of the artificial intelligence, and it tries to help people to learn from the data and solve the problem. As time goes, the focus of the machine learning has shifted from “inference” and “knowledge” to “learning”.
In the history of Machine Learning, Arthur Samuel was the person who named it as Machine Learning in 1959. In the early development period of machine learning, people tried to use symbolic methods and statistics to learn from the data, but it could not meet all people needs to handle problems which included complex logic and knowledge. Therefore, in 1980, the statistics were no longer the focus of the researchers to develop machine learning. In 1990, people had shifted the goal of machine learning from achieving artificial intelligence to actually solving the problem. Thus, instead of working on the symbolic approaches, people started to pay more attention on the methods and model that they obtained from previous probability theory. Then, Machine Learning began to catch the eyeballs of more people and develop vigorously after then. Currently, machine learning has been widely used in many fileds in the world, such as data mining,medical diagnostics, detection of credit card fraud and so on; and it is still trying to penetrate into more fields.
