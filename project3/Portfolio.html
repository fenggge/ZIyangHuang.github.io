      <p>Nowadays, machine learning and the web have become pretty prevalent and popular in people’s lives, and its system and technology have become pretty complete and mature as well. Thus, more and more people choose to use machine learning and web to take classes because machine learning makes it much easier for people to learn.

For example, Youtube collects and displays millions of videos that incorporate abundant information and lessons of almost every subject, and they are free for everyone. Therefore, people could watch the videos at any time they want and watch as many times as they like, which makes it very convenient for people. Also, when people are watching the videos, they can pause the video at any time to take notes or go back and listen again about the part that they are confused about or they could speed up and jump to the important part as they want. Therefore, this characteristic of machine learning effectively improves the efficiency of studying. In addition, many of the machine learning webs, such as Udemy, also provides the practice questions like quizzes and tests, helping learners to better understand the concept and get ready for the official exams. Accordingly, machine learning and the web have deeply participated in many aspects of our society like education, business, and so on, and it still tries to penetrate into more fields in people’s life.
